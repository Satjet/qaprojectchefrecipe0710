## Link up Chef to Recipes

Project is to link up a Celebrity Chef with choice of 3 recipes for the user to select (Working in Git / GitHub)

## Front End:  

* HMTL: User Log In 

## Web Task:           

* Basic Web Application on Flask web framework with CRUD functionality
* Entity relationship Chef & Recipes

* Page 3 Third Recipe:   	Caesarâ€™s Salad 
* (Total 4 Pages)


## Back End Tasks:     
	
* Set up 2 x Azure VM with same Resourse Name.
* VM 1 (Manager Node), 
* VM 2 (Worker Node)
* Database SQLlite3 to hold Chef details and 3 recipes (4 x Hyperlinks)
* Application hosted on container & deployed on Docker.

## Install the VM's with following:
         
* Linux, 
* Python with Flask, 
* Docker,
* Port Numbers
* Visual Studio Code
* Jenkins

## Database Task:      
												
* SQLlite3
* Store hyperlink description of the 3 recipes that can be pulled by the user showing
* Prepartion time,
* Ingredients required,
* Method
* Photo of finished item, 
* Additional Task: User information to stored on database.
* Additional Task: store more recipies on database linking to Chef.
* Additional Task: add in more chefs with recipes expanding the use of database.

## Check Tasks:      

* CRUD, (Create, Read, Update, & Delete)
* Create = 	Front end website, 
* Read = 	Home Page & Recipe, 
* Update = 	Refresh Webpage for next Recipe, 
* Delete = 	Old receipes

* MosCoW, 
* Must Have = 		Code must work after Pipeline build and test to deploy.
* Should Have = 	Must have 4 pages on web = Chef and 3 recipes.
* Could Have = 		Choice of non-veg and veg recipes
* Won't Have Time = 	Add in cooking utencils required for each recipe
* Testing with pytest application
                    
 ## Build Tasks:       
 						
* Set up VM Severs with installations
* Visual Studio to regualrly push to GitHub
* CI CD (Build, Test & Deploy) Run on Jenkins
* Run unit tests
* Build Docker Images
* Push Docker image to regisrty
* Deployment on Docker Swarm on VM
* GitHub Webhook to push new code to repository and trigger pipeline.

## Deployment:

* Hosted on Docker Swarm on Cloud 
* 2 nodes (1 x Manager, 1 x Worker)

## Deliverable:

* GitHub repository to contain all codes,
* Source Code
* Jenkins Configuration
* Docker Configuration
* Related Scripts
* Video evidence of CI CD Pipeline working.

## Summary:

* Brief explanation of App Fulfillment
* Technical descripion of how the application works
* Techincal description of how Pipeline works
* Report on success of code and unit tests
* Future improvements
* Provide Mind Map / ERD
* Provide Diagrams / Illistrations
* Video demonstrating CRUD, CI CD pipeline in action
